Building From Source
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Download Apache ANT from http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi or use an IDE with it
       inbuilt.
	2. Ensure you have a Java JDK to build against
    3. Ensure you have the TeamCity jars available to compile against
	4. Update the build.xml property teamcity.home to point to the TeamCity jar files location.
    3. From the root directory of the downloaded source, run "ant jars"
	4. Grab the compiled cradiator.jar from the build/classes/ directory

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming you have already built the source and you have a cradiator.jar

Assuming that Team City is installed in the directory $TEAMCITY_HOME:

    * Copy the cradiator.jar file into the directory $TEAMCITY_HOME/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib/
    * Restart the Team City server
  
Point your Cradiator configuration at the following URL:

    http://<teamcity-server>:<port>/guestAuth/cradiator.html?projectId=<projectid>

E.g. if the server is running on localhost, port 8111 and the project "Test" has a project id
     of "project2" then use:
    
    http://localhost:8111/guestAuth/cradiator.html?projectId=project2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
TeamCity Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * Ensure your TeamCity server has the Guest account enabled
    * For any build that you want to see in Cradiator, make sure that you have "Enable 
      status widget" checked in the general settings of that build
